# Alumni Network
 
The key participants in the suggested system are the donor alumni, the organization, and the students. Alumni can donate money to the college through this platform. All of these transactions occur in a distributed way and are recorded in a blockchain ledger. Alumni can login into the system and donate money. They can track their donated funds. MetaMask is used as a wallet for transactions.

# Smart Contract 

Smart contract creates the ‘VIT tokens’ and the user can issue these tokens using their MetaMask wallet address. Initially, a total of 1000000 VIT Tokens are supplied by the smart contract. The user can issue these tokens for donation purpose.
The transfer function in the smart contract determines whether the sender has enough tokens in their wallet and transfers the given number of tokens to the provided address.
